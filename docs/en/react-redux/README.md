# React and Redux usage in Pogues

This application is built with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux). React is a library to build user interfaces in a declarative way. Redux is a small library which provides tools to hold the application state (all the data handled by the application) and implements an unidirectional data-flow architecture (the process to re-render the application when something changes)

The following sections provide the necessary background for people who are new to React and Redux. Hence, you can try to follow along with no prior knowledge of these technologies, but you might need to refer at some points to the external resources mentioned to find more detailed information.

If you are familiar with these technologies, you can still skim through this introduction to find some information about how React and Redux are used within Pogues (see for instance [split and combine reducers](/react-redux/reducers-split-combine.md)).

We will study the already implemented "edit a list of codes" functionality to show how the application works.
