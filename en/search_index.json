started\nPogues is a Single Page Application built with React and Redux. To run the application in development mode, run the following commands from a shell prompt in the local directory, and then navigate to http://localhost:3000:\n# Download all the dependencies needed by the application\nnpm install\n# Compiles the code and starts a minimal web server (see below)\nnpm run dev\nYou will only be able to create and edit a questionnaire locally. You won't be able to save it, visualize it or use some external resources (like some list of codes) within your questionnaire: Pogues serves only as a front-end application to design questionnaires and relies on tiers Web services to process these operations. More information on this in remote APIs.\nBuild\nTo build the application, run npm run build. You can now serve the content of the dist folder with the HTTP server of your choice.\nNote that you will probably first need to update the config file to point to the proper URLs and paths for the web services Pogues will rely on.\nNew to JavaScript and Node.js\nIf you're new to JavaScript, you might need to first install node and npm on your computer. You should download NodeJS \nnpm is the Node.js package manager. npm install will download all the dependencies needed by the project, as described in the dependencies and devDepedencies sections of the package.json file.\nnpm run dev will launch the dev command defined in the scripts section of the same package.json file. This command will launch a local web server serving the main HTML file (src/js/index.html) and all the relevant assets. Read more about Webpack usage.\nnpm run build will launch the compilation with some optimizations for production. It copies all the static assets and the resulting bundle file in the dist folder.\n"},"developper-guide/react-redux/":{"url":"developper-guide/react-redux/","title":"React and Redux introduction","keywords":"","body":"React and Redux usage in Pogues\nThis application is built with React and Redux. React is a library to build user interfaces in a declarative way. Redux is a small library which provides tools to hold the application state (all the data handled by the application) and implements an unidirectional data-flow architecture (the process to re-render the application when something changes)\nThe following sections provide the necessary background for people who are new to React and Redux. Hence, you can try to follow along with no prior knowledge of these technologies, but you might need to refer at some points to the external resources mentioned to find more detailed information.\nIf you are familiar with these technologies, you can still skim through this introduction to find some information about how React and Redux are used within Pogues (see for instance split and combine reducers).\nWe will study the already implemented \"edit a list of codes\" functionality to show how the application works.\nFigure: Code list edition\n"},"developper-guide/react-redux/react/":{"url":"developper-guide/react-redux/react/","title":"React","keywords":"","body":"React\nIf you don't know anything about React, the official React documentation can be a good place to start.\n If you are already familiar with React, you can skip to the section about Redux.\n"},"developper-guide/react-redux/react/components.html":{"url":"developper-guide/react-redux/react/components.html","title":"Components","keywords":"","body":"React components\nA piece of UI in React is called a component. We will start working with a simplified version of the CodeEditor component from the src/js/components/code-editor.js file:\nFigure: CodeEditor component\nIn order to promote design of reusable components and enforce a modular coding style, components should be as elementary as possible. Then, we can build more complex components by composing simple ones. From this perspective, our CodeEditor should be seen as a composition of two different components:\n\nthe input field;\nthe controls, which in turn could be split into three components, one for each button.\n\nYet, to keep things simple and to stick to the code, we will consider the CodeEditor as an elementary block.\nIf we ignore layout and style instructions, HTML for this editor looks like this:\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nWhich can be represented in React with:\nimport React from 'react'\n\nexport default function CodeEditor() {\n  return (\n    \n      \n       \n          \n          \n          \n       \n    \n  )\n}\n\nWe notice that:\n\nthe CodeEditor component is represented as a function;\nthis function returns some HTML like syntax; this is called JSX and provides a convenient way to write components; during the compilation process, JSX will be transformed to regular JavaScript, and this function will eventually return a React element;\nthere are some small differences between JSX and HTML (here, the attribute className in place of the regular class attribute in HTML, and the attribute defaultValue instead of value);\nwe export (read more about exports) the component in order to use it to build the CodeListEditor component.\n\nWe need to tell React to render the application into an existing div of the src/index.html. That's what the ReactDOM.render is used for (more in bootstrap the application).\nReactDOM.render(\n  ,\n  document.getElementById('base')\n)\n\nIf you want to experience with the code, you can start with this pen (all the code stays in one pen, so there is no import or export statements). \n\n\n\n\n\n,\n  document.getElementById('base')\n);\n\n\nfunction CodeEditor() {\n  return (\n    \n      \n       \n          \n          \n          \n       \n    \n  )\n}\n-->"},"developper-guide/react-redux/react/combining-components.html":{"url":"developper-guide/react-redux/react/combining-components.html","title":"Combining components","keywords":"","body":"Combining components\nLet's see how we can use this simple CodeEditor component to build the more complex CodeListEditor component. \nimport React\nimport CodeEditor from './code-editor'\n\nexport default function CodeListEditor() {\n  return (\n    \n      {/* \n        We won't implement the edition of the code list Label.\n        Notice that comments look different from HTML in JSX.\n      */}\n      Add a code\n      \n        \n        \n        \n      \n    \n  )\n}\n\nUntil now, each CodeEditor looks exactly the same, with \"unhappy\" as a label.

In order to value the label prop within CodeEditor, we need to update our component:\nfunction CodeEditor(props) {\n  const { label } = props\n  return (\n    \n      \n       \n          \n          \n          \n       \n    \n  )\n}\n\nWhen called, a component described as a function will receive as its first and only argument an object with all the data passed by its parent.

To use the setState method, we will need to make some adjustments to our CodeListEditor.\nThe right way\nTo use the setState method aforementioned, we need to use a different syntax to describe the component: \nimport React from 'react'\nclass CodeListEditor extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    const codes = ...\n    return (\n      \n        \n        ...\n      \n    )\n  }\n}\n\nWe've just copied the body from our component function to the body of another function: the render method of a ES6 class which extends React.Component.\nFor now, nothing has changed: the UI is still not updating when we try to add a code. But this syntax exposes some additional functionalities. Among them is the option to call the setState method to tell the component something has changed and it should be re-rendered. \nimport React from 'react'\nclass CodeListEditor extends React.Component {\n  constructor() {\n    super()\n    //we initialize the state with the 3 codes\n    this.state = {\n      codes: [{\n        id: 'code_1',\n        label: 'unhappy'\n      }, {\n        id: 'code_2',\n        label: 'happy',\n      }, {\n        id: 'code_3',\n        label: 'very happy'\n      }]\n    }\n    this.addCode = () => {\n      const { codes } = this.state\n      const newId = `code_${codes.length+1}`\n      //Instead of updating the codes in place, with `codes.push`, we prefer to\n      //make a copy of the initial codes and append the new code at the end.\n      const newCodes = [...codes, { id: newId, label: 'very unhappy' }]\n      //we can now use `setState` to make this new array of codes part of the\n      //component state.

But this approach does not always scale seamlessly when application complexity grows. Let's for instance have a look at the expected behavior if the user created a list of codes, referenced it in two different places in the questionnaire, and then add or edit some codes to the list:\nFigure: Code list editors should be kept in sync\n(The edition panels have been toggled on for each of these questions, and the UI has been slightly modified to make the editors stand closer one to the other.)\nThe two code list editors should be kept in sync. This goal will be difficult to achieve with our previous approach. Indeed, if the codes are stored in the state of the first CodeListEditor, the second code list editor will not be aware of any updates to the codes, and, as a consequence, won't be able to update accordingly. \nThis problem with keeping code list editors in sync is a very common issue with complex web applications in general, and with Pogues in particular:  there are many other scenarios where an action might have some effects on different parts of the UI. To illustrate, we can think about what should happen when the user edits the id of a question referenced in a goTo.  In this situation, the application needs:\n\nto update every visible redirection that can be impacted by this edition (for example a redirection referring to the previous id should be now marked as invalid);\nto adjust the integrity controls panel at the top of the questionnaire to update the messages accordingly (for instance by adding an error message concerning the redirection which has just become invalid).\n\nFigure: Keep in sync multiple components\nThe solution\nTo tackle these \"might be very complex\" updates, React and Redux promote the use of a unidirectional data flow. This presentation of the flux pattern can be a useful reading, even if there might be at some point some slight differences with Redux (which can be seen as one implementation of the flux architecture; in Redux, there is only one store).\nIn a few words\nThe idea is to store the codes a code list is made of not in the component state, but in a \"higher\" level abstraction that will make the data potentially available to every component . This abstraction is called the \"application state\" and gathers in one place all the data needed to build and update the UI. In Redux the application state is handled by a store.\nThen, we use actions to notify the application that something happened and that the state should be updated accordingly. To do this with Redux, we create:\n\nactions that describe what happened (for instance, we added a code to a list of codes); actions will be dispatched to the store;\nsome reducers which specify how the application state should be updated to react to a given action.\n\nFinally, the whole application will be re-rendered according to the new state (setState will be called automatically on the top component of our application), but thanks to React diffing algorithm, only parts of the UI actually modified will be updated in the DOM.\nFigure: Flux data flow\n"},"developper-guide/react-redux/redux/component-with-redux.html":{"url":"developper-guide/react-redux/redux/component-with-redux.html","title":"A component with Redux","keywords":"","body":"A component with Redux\nBefore diving more into Redux, let's have a look at what the code will look like after switching to Redux to represent the application state: \nfunction CodeListEditor({ codes, addCode, editCodeLabel }) {\n  return (\n    \n      { \n        codes.map(( {id, label }) => \n          \n             editCodeLabel(id, val)}\n               />\n          \n        )\n      }\n    \n  )\n}\n\nThe code editor by itself will not be impacted (it was already a stateless component, so it did not contain any state).\nNotice that the CodeListEditor:\n\nis now a stateless component represented as a function;\nis supposed to be passed by its parent some props: the codes the code list is made of, a function to add a code and one to edit a code (in order to make a fully functional component, we should also pass it some functions to move up, move down and remove a code).\n\nIn the next sections, we will see:\n\nhow to model the application state;\nhow to make a component use some piece of state stored in the application state;\nhow to make the application state change when actions occur.\n\n"},"developper-guide/react-redux/redux/model-the-state.html":{"url":"developper-guide/react-redux/redux/model-the-state.html","title":"Model the state","keywords":"","body":"Model the state\nBefore going further, we need to think about how to model the application state.

Then, connect will use mapStateToProps to wrap the initial component into a higher order component, which given some id, will retrieve the codes from the application state, and render the initial component with these codes passed as a prop.\nIn practice, we don't need to rename our initial component CodeListEditorDumb, since this name is only used locally (in the connect call at the end of the file). See export default to learn more about how exports work.\nOur CodeListEditor will now be able to get the information directly from the store.

As a consequence, we were not able to process user actions. In order to build a more useful reducer, we need to have a closer look at the reducer second argument: the action.\nAn action is a plain JavaScript object describing what happened. For instance, the following action can be used to describe what the user did when he edited a code label:\nconst anAction = {\n  type: 'EDIT_CODE_LABEL', //what kind of action happened\n  payload: { //details about this action\n    id: 'code_2', //which code are we dealing with ?\n    label: 'regular happy' //the new label\n  }\n}\n\nIf we pass this action as a second argument to our reducer (with the state used in the last section as its first argument), we expect it to return a new state, where the label for the code with id code_2 has been replaced with \"regular happy\".\nconst previousState = {\n  codeListById: {...}\n  codeById: {\n    ...\n    code_2: {\n      label: 'happy'\n    }\n    ...\n  }\n}\n\nconst newState = simpleReducer(previousState, anAction)\n\nWe expect newState to equal to:\n{\n  codeListById: {...}\n  codeById: {\n    ...\n    code_2: {\n      //the only change concerns the code_2 label\n      label: 'regular happy'\n    }\n    ...\n  }\n}\n\nIn order to achieve this, here is a possible implementation of the reducer:\nfunction simpleReducer(state, action) {\n  if (action.type === 'EDIT_CODE_LABEL') {\n    return {\n      //codeListById will not be impacted by this action, since it only keeps\n      //track of code ids, not code labels\n      codeListById: state.codeListById,\n      codeById: {\n        //see notes below if the syntax bothers you\n        //we keep all the codes unchanged...\n        ...state.codeById,\n        //...except for the code which was edited, which needs to be updated to\n        //take into account the new label\n        [action.payload.id]: {\n          label: action.payload.label\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  //we return the current state: the action is not supposed to have any effect\n  //on the state\n  else return state\n}\n\nA reducer should be a pure function, which means that it cannot mutate the initial state. The following implementation would not comply to this rule:\nfunction simpleReducer(state, action){\n  if (action.type === 'EDIT_CODE_LABEL') {\n    state.codeById[action.payload.id].label = action.payload.label\n  }\n  return state\n}\n\nIt returns the expected new state (with the label \"regular happy\" for code_2), \nbut it mutated the initial state (in fact, the initial state and the next state\nare the same object).\nThe reducer implementation uses the spread operator with objects  and computed property names to make writing immutable updates shorter.\nInitial state\nA reducer takes a previous state and an action, and returns a new state. At initialization, no previous state is available. A common pattern is to use ES2015 default parameters to give our state an initial value. In our example, we could use the hard coded state we worked with:\nconst initialState = {\n  codeListById: {\n    code_list_1: { ... },\n    ...\n  },\n  codeById: {\n    code_1: { ... },\n    ...\n  }\n}\n\nfunction myReducer(state=initialState, action) {\n  ...\n}\n\n"},"developper-guide/react-redux/redux/dispatch-actions.html":{"url":"developper-guide/react-redux/redux/dispatch-actions.html","title":"Dispatch actions","keywords":"","body":"Dispatch actions\nIn the last section, we built a reducer which given the following action, returned a new state where the label for the corresponding code had been updated:\nconst anAction = {\n  type: 'EDIT_CODE_LABEL', //what kind of action happened\n  payload: { //details about this action\n    id: 'code_2', //which code are we dealing with ?\n    label: 'regular happy' //the new label\n  }\n}\n\nWe also saw that thanks to the connect mechanism from React Redux, our application renders according to the data containing in the store.\nThe missing part here consists of telling to the store that an action occurred, in order to make the reducer return the new state. This what is called \"dispatch an action\" to the store. We don't necessarily need React Redux for this, but here again, the React Redux connect function makes things easy.\nAction creator\nFirst, let's wrap our action with a function, which given a code id and a value, will return the corresponding action:\nfunction editCodeLabel(id, label) {\n  return {\n    type: 'EDIT_CODE_LABEL',\n    payload: {\n      id, //ES1015 shorthand for id: id\n      label\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nRead more about the shorthand notation.\nThen, our action can be created with:\nconst anAction = editCodeLabel('code_2', 'regular happy')\n\nThe editCodeLabel function is called an action creator.\nUse connect second argument\nWe can then extend our previous example by giving a second argument to the connect function:\n\n//We assume the `editCodeLabel` function above was defined in a file called\n//`actions`\nimport { editCodeLabel } from './actions'\n\n...\n\n//The component will receive a new prop: a function named `editCodeLabel`. This\n//function is not the `editCodeLabel` function we imported, but a new function\n//provided by the connect mechanism.\nfunction CodeListEditorDumb({ codes, editCodeLabel }) {\n  return (\n    ...\n      {\n        codes.map(({ id, label }, i) => \n          //We use `editCodeLabel` to handle changes in each code editor, (we\n          //use an arrow function to give the proper id as a first argument)\n           editCodeLabel(id, val)} />)    \n      }\n    ...\n  )\n}\n\nconst mapStateToProps = ...\n\n\n//The connect second argument is often called `mapDispatchToProps`. In its\n//simplest version, it is an object where each key represents an action\n//creator (ie a function which returns an action)\nconst mapDispatchToProps = {\n  editCodeLabel: editCodeLabel //we could use ES2015 shorthand notation\n}\n\nexport default \n  connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(CodeListEditorDumb)\n\nWhen the editCodeLabel function is called from the CodeListEditor component (more precisely from a CodeEditor component), the returned value of the raw editCodeLabel function will be dispatched to the store. In other words, the connect mechanism wraps the action creator with a dispatch call to the store.\nTo help you grasp what connect did to the initial editCodeLabel function, you can consider that it replaced it with the following editCodeLabelAfterConnect function:\nfunction editCodeLabelAfterConnect(id, value) {\n  //the connect mechanism can access the store\n  store.dispatch(editCodeLabel(id, value))\n}\n\nYou can play with this pen. Notice that the codes are updated and the UI re-rendered.\n\n\n\n"},"developper-guide/react-redux/redux/reducers-split-combine.html":{"url":"developper-guide/react-redux/redux/reducers-split-combine.html","title":"Split and combine reducers","keywords":"","body":"Reducers - Split and combine\nWe can now try to implement the \"add a code\" functionality. We need:\n\nto add a new action creator;\nto process the corresponding action within the reducer.\n\nThe action creator needs to know which code list we're adding a code to:\nlet lastId = 0\nfunction addCode(codeListId) {\n  return {\n    type: 'ADD_CODE',\n    payload: {\n      codeListId,\n      id: `new_code_${lastId++}`\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nNotice we gave an id to our code. To keep things simple, we created an incremental id, but in the real application we use a randomly generated id.\nThe reducer logic gets more complex: \nfunction simpleReducer(state, action) {\n  if (action.type === 'EDIT_CODE_LABEL') {\n    ...\n  }\n  else if (action.type === 'ADD_CODE') {\n    //get the relevant code list\n    const codeList = state.codeListById[payload.codeListId]\n    //get the actual codes for the code list\n    const codes = codeList.codes\n    //add the code id at the end\n    const newCodesIds = [...codeIds, payload.id]\n    //update `codeListById` with the new codes\n    const codeListById = {\n      ...state.codeListById,\n      [payload.codeListId]: {\n        ...codeList,//we keep all exiting keys in the code list (here the\n                    //code list label)\n        codes: newCodesIds //we udpate the codes key\n      }\n    }\n    //we update the codes by adding an entry for the new code\n    const codeById = {\n      ...state.codeById,\n      [payload.id]: {\n        label: ''\n      }\n    }\n    //we return the new state\n    return {\n      codeListById,\n      codeById\n    }\n  }\n  //we return the current state: the action is not supposed to have any effect\n  //on the state\n  else return state\n}\n\nThe code gets quickly very long: we need to process the effects on the different state's entries, without mutating the initial state (which would have made the code shorter). Thanks to the way we shape our state (one entry per kind of entity with references across entities based on ids, as opposed to a nested structure where code lists would contain code descriptions), we can easily split our main reducer into two smaller reducers, working independently one from another:\n\na reducer to handle the code lists;\na reducer to handle the codes.\n\nWe then combine these reducers to handle all the application logic.\nimport { combineReducers } from 'redux'\n\nfunction codeListByIdReducer(state, action) {\n  const { type, payload } = action\n  if (type === 'ADD_CODE') {\n    const codeList = state[payload.codeListId]\n    return {\n      ...state,\n      [payload.codeListId]: {\n        ...codeList,\n        codes: [...codeList.codes, payload.id]\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  else return state\n}\n\nfunction codeByIdReducer(state, action) {\n  const { type, payload } = action\n  if (type === 'EDIT_CODE_LABEL') {\n    const code = state[payload.id]\n    return {\n      ...state,\n      [payload.id]: {\n        ...code,\n        label: payload.label\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  else if (action.type === 'ADD_CODE') {\n    return {\n      ...state,\n      [payload.id]: {\n        label: ''\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  else return state\n}\n\nconst mainReducer = combineReducers({\n  codeListById: codeListByIdReducer,\n  codeById: codeByIdReducer\n})\n\nWe can now update our CodeListEditor component to pass it the addCode function (the action creator wrapped into a dispatch call through the connect mechanism):\n//The `addCode` action creator  needs to be passed the id of the code list\n//we're adding a code to. Hence, the `addCode` function passed to the\n//`CodeListEditorDumb` component (which wraps the action creator with\n//a dispatch call) needs this argument too.

These components can be used with standard HTML inputs (input, textarea), but also with our own components. An interface has to be respected, and will be explained later in this documentation.\nthe use of the reducer of the library, in order to manage the triggered actions. In our project, this configuration is defined in the src/reducers/index.js file.\n\nimport { combineReducers } from 'redux';\nimport { reducer as form } from 'redux-form';\n\nexport default integrityChecker(\n  combineReducers({\n    form,\n  }),\n);\nreduxForm\nIn order to connect or form to the Redux store, we need to export the component returned by the reduxForm method. This will give to Redux Forms the possibility to detect all interactions the user has with your form, in order to update the store. You can have a look to the form used when creating a new formulaire\nexport default reduxForm({\n  form: 'component',\n})(QuestionNewEdit);\nThis method take one object, with only on mandatory parameter : the name of the form, that will be used for naming your data in the store.\nThe data inserted in your form will be passed as a parameter to the method executed when the submit event of the form is triggered. For example, in the same form, here is the method managing the submit event (defined in the ComponentNewContainer component)\nconst submit = values => {\n    createComponent(values, parentId, weight, type).then(updateParentChildren).then(orderComponents).then(result => {\n        const { payload: { id } } = result;\n        setSelectedComponentId(id);\n        if (onSuccess) onSuccess(id);\n    });\n};\nHere are some actions managed by Redux Forms. For each actions, Redux Forms will udate the store, and rerender the component : FOCUS, CHANGE, BLUR, SUBMIT, ...\nCustom Components\nIt is necessary to use the Field component, in order to connect our form to the store.\nThis component can be used with standard HTML input, but also with our own components, if you want to factorize your code. These components are defined in the src/layout/forms/controls folder. These components will give the possibility to standardize the stylesheets of our inputs, their labels or error messages.\nThese components have to follow a specific interface in order to be used with Redux Forms.\nIf you do not have to modify the inserted data, you just need to pass the input property, managed by the Field component, as a props to the HTML/React component. You can have a look the implementation of the input.jsx component.\nError: file not found: /github/workspace/local_source/src/forms/controls/input.jsx\n\nIf you need to modify the data, before the sync with the store, during the initialisation of your component, you can have access to the default value thanks to the property props.input.value, and when the user has inserted a data, you need to call manually the props.input.onChange method.\nIn order to specify the component you want to use with the Field component, you need to specify the component parameter:\n\n\nThanks to the meta property, you have access to the metadatas managed by Redux Forms, for example is my input valid or not,... These properties are automatically updated when actions defined previously (FOCUS, ...) are triggered by the library.\nData Validation\nYou can validate your data with two different syntaxes.\n\nBy defining a validation function as a parameter to the reduxForm method. This function will take as a parameter the datas of your form, and will need to return an object with the different errors.\n\nHere is an example of validating a form with this syntax :\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { Field, reduxForm } from 'redux-form'\n\nconst validate = values => {\n  const errors = {}\n  if (!values.username) {\n    errors.username = 'Required'\n  } else if (values.username.length > 15) {\n    errors.username = 'Must be 15 characters or less'\n  }\n  if (!values.email) {\n    errors.email = 'Required'\n  } else if (!/^[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Z]{2,4}$/i.test(values.email)) {\n    errors.email = 'Invalid email address'\n  }\n  if (!values.age) {\n    errors.age = 'Required'\n  } else if (isNaN(Number(values.age))) {\n    errors.age = 'Must be a number'\n  } else if (Number(values.age)  {\n  const warnings = {}\n  if (values.age \n  \n    \n      {label}\n    \n    \n      \n      {touched &&\n        ((error &&\n          \n            {error}\n          ) ||\n          (warning &&\n            \n              {warning}\n            ))}\n    \n  \n\nconst SyncValidationForm = props => {\n  const { handleSubmit, pristine, reset, submitting } = props\n  return (\n    \n      \n      \n      \n      \n        \n          Submit\n        \n        \n          Clear Values\n        \n      \n    \n  )\n}\n\nexport default reduxForm({\n  form: 'syncValidation',\n  validate,\n})(SyncValidationForm)\n\nFor the second syntax, we can define an array of validation functions for each input of our form. Redux Form do not provide validators, you need to implement these methods manually. In our application, these fonctions are defined in the validation-rules.js file.\n\nYou will find an example of this syntax in the questionnaire-new-edit component.\n"},"developper-guide/react-redux/additional-information.html":{"url":"developper-guide/react-redux/additional-information.html","title":"Additional information","keywords":"","body":"Miscellaneous informations about React and Redux\nThis section presents some additional information you might find useful if you are new to these technologies.\nProptypes\nWe use PropTypes to document what React components expect as props.

These components use some loadSomethingIfNeeded like function in their useEffect() hooks. For instance, the PageQuestionnaire component calls loadCampaignsIfNeeded when it is mounted. This section explains how this process works.\nNetwork requests\nThe network requests are written in the src/api/remote-api.js file. They rely on the fetch API. A polyfill is provided for browsers which do not support it, via the babel-polyfill.\nExample:\n/**\n * Retrieve questionnaire\n * path like '/pogues/questionnaire:id'\n */\nexport const getQuestionnaire = id =>\n  fetch(urlGetQuestionnaire + '/' + id, {\n    headers: {\n      Accept: 'application/JSON',\n    },\n  }).then(res => res.JSON());\n\nThis module exports some functions which return a Promise. It the remote call succeeds, the Promise will resolve to:\n\nthe expected raw data (res.JSON()) for GET operations;\nthe raw response if no data needs to be extracted from the response;\nvalue of a header field if relevant.\n\nThis file mixes calls for all of the three services:\n\nvisualization (stromaePostQuestionnaire);\npersistence (getQuestionnaire, putQuestionnaire, getQuestionnaireList...);\nrepository (getCodeListSpecs, getCodeList).\n\nAction creators\nTo trigger remote calls, we use action creators in combination with Redux Thunk middleware. We follow the pattern for asyncrhonous actions from the Redux documentation.\nWith Redux Thunk, action creators can return a function instead of a plain JavaScript object. Hence, we can write asynchronous actions with a function which:\n\nsynchronously dispatches a plain JavaScript object action to indicate that the request has been registered; action type follows the LOAD_SOMETHING naming convention;\nsends the request (with functions from the aforementioned src/api/remote-api.js file, like getQuestionnaire);\nasynchronously dispatches a LOAD_SOMETHING_SUCCESS action if the Promise returned by the fetch call succeeds (then handler), or a LOAD_SOMETHING_FAILURE if it fails (catch handler);\nreturns the Promise for possible further processing.\n\nExample from src/js/actions/questionnaire.js (in the initial code we use arrow functions instead of the regular function definitions shown here):\nimport { getQuestionnaire } from '(...)/remote-api';\n\nexport function loadQuestionnaire(id) {\n  //Thanks to Redux Thunk, we can return a function from our action creator.\n  //This function will be passed two arguments by the Redux Thunk middleware:\n  //a `dispatch` function to dispatch to the store, and a `getState` function\n  //(not used here) to read the current application state.\n  return function (dispatch, getState) {\n    dispatch({\n      type: LOAD_QUESTIONNAIRE,\n      payload: id,\n    });\n    return getQuestionnaire(id)\n      .then(qr => {\n        dispatch(loadQuestionnaireSuccess(id, questionnaireToState(qr)));\n      })\n      .catch(err => {\n        dispatch(loadQuestionnaireFailure(id, err.toString()));\n      });\n  };\n}\n\nexport function loadQuestionnaireSuccess(id, update) {\n  return {\n    type: LOAD_QUESTIONNAIRE_SUCCESS,\n    payload: { id, update },\n  };\n}\n\nexport function loadQuestionnaireFailure(id, err) {\n  return {\n    type: LOAD_QUESTIONNAIRE_FAILURE,\n    payload: { id, err },\n  };\n}\n\nNote: we should probably avoid usage of catch here (see #146)\nTODO screenshot devtools\nDo not ask twice for the same resource\nWe also use Redux Thunk to define some action creators that will take care of not loading a resource again if it is available locally from the application state:\nexport function loadQuestionnaireIfNeeded(id) {\n  return function (dispatch, getState) {\n    const state = getState();\n    const qr = state.questionnaireById[id];\n    if (!qr) return dispatch(loadQuestionnaire(id));\n  };\n}\n\nThese loadSomethingIfNeeded action creators can be called from React componentWillMount and componentWillReceiveProps life cycle methods.\nExample from the src/js/components/questionnaire-container.js file:\nclass QuestionnaireContainer extends Component {\n\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props)\n  }\n\n  componentWillMount() {\n    this.props.loadQuestionnaireIfNeeded(this.props.qrId)\n  }\n\n  componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps) {\n    if (nextProps.qrId !== this.props.qrId)\n      this.props.loadQuestionnaireIfNeeded(nextProps.qrId)\n  }\n  ...\n}\n\n"},"developper-guide/remote-apis/visualization.html":{"url":"developper-guide/remote-apis/visualization.html","title":"Visualization","keywords":"","body":"Visualize questionnaires\nThis service takes a questionnaire description and returns an URL to visualize the questionnaire.\nConfiguration\nURL and path for this service are configured in src/js/config/config.js, with baseURL and stromaePath entries. \nJSON representation\nThe questionnaires are serialized in Hson and comply to the schema.

Here is a global picture:\n\nThe application shows the QuestionnairePicker component.\nThe user selects a questionnaire in the questionnaire list.\nThe switchQuestionnaire action creator  is called.\nThe SWITCH_TO_QUESTIONNAIRE action is dispatched. It contains the questionnaire id in its payload.\nThe switchToQuestionnaire handler from the appState reducer updates the view entry and set it to QUESTIONNAIRE.\nThe application re-renders.\nWhen rendering the main PoguesApp component, the view entry is checked, and the QuestionnaireContainer component is rendered, in place of the previous QuestionnairePicker component.\nIn its componentWillMount method, the loadQuestionnaireIfNeeded function is called. It takes the questionnaire id as an argument.\nAssuming the questionnaire has not been already loaded, the loadQuestionnaire action creator is called.\nThe component renders a spinner to indicate that the questionnaire is loading.\nThe LOAD_QUESTIONNAIRE action will be dispatched, with the questionnaire id in its payload.\nThe getQuestionnaire function is called. The browser tries to fetch the given resource and returns a Promise.\n. The fetch call succeeds and the Promise resolves to a JSON representation of the questionnaire.\nThe then handler in the action creators file is executed.\nIt calls the toSate function and dispatches the LOAD_QUESTIONNAIRE_SUCCESS action with the result of this function in its payload.\nThe LOAD_QUESTIONNAIRE_SUCCESS is processed by many reducers to update the application state: to add an entry in the questionnaires-by-id reducer, to add multiple entries in the components-by-id reducer (one for each sequence and each question in the questionnaire), to add multiple entries in the code-by-id reducer (one for each code in every code list in the questionnaire)...\nThe application re renders.

Thanks to the babel plugin for Webpack, we can make use in our code of some JavaScript features which are not widely supported: babel will transform the code you write to make it work in all major browsers.\nWebpack will also process the main css file to make it load faster and work consistently across browsers.\nimport { useOidc } from '../../../utils/oidc';\n\nWebpack is configured via the webpack.config.js file. Refer to this file to see all the operations this configuration handle.\nWebpack will transform the JavaScript code you write, but in order to make debugging easier, it will provide source maps to enable browsers to show the original files within the developer tools.\nDuring development, npm run dev will act as a background task:\n\nproviding a simple HTTP server to serve the application assets on port 3000;\nwatching for file modifications and recompiling the application accordingly;\nautomatically reloading the page in the browser to take the modifications into account.\nThe npm run dev script is configured to work with a \"in memory\" version of the bundle file (--content-base command line option for webpack-dev-server), hence the JavaScript file served to the browsers might not be visible in the dist folder on your hard drive.\n\nThe Webpack configuration for production is slightly different from the one used for development: it does not need the configuration related to the development web server.

If a scripts is named component.js, the file for the corresponding unit tests will be located in the same folder and named component.spec.js. \nAll page of the application is defined in a dedicated folder, located in the src folder. Every component needed for this page is défined in a components subdirectory, and all components connected to the Redux``store in a containers subdirectory. \nAll composants used in any pages will be defined in the layout folder. \nMost of the time, and it should be seen a rule of thumb, we only export one component per file and we use a default export.\nIf a component needs to be connected to the store, what is exported as default is the the result of the React Redux connect mechanism.\nActions\nIn this folder, we will define all Redux actions used by the application, in order to update the data managed by the store. These different actions will only define the data we want to update, and trigger an action, managed by a reducer. \nSome actions have effects on only one reducer. For instance, only the codes-by-id reducer needs to know about the EDIT_CODE action. But others have effects on multiple reducers. For instance, when a CREATE_CODE action is dispatched:\n\nthe codes-by-id reducer needs to add an entry for this new code;\nthe code-list-by-id reducer (which should in fact be named code-lists-by-id) needs to add this code to the code list it belongs to.\n\nThis pattern is recurrent and the following convention was chosen: all the actions concerning a given kind of entity (for instance codes) will stay in a file named after this entity (ie src/js/actions/codes.js). So actions like CREATE_CODE, REMOVE_CODE or MOVE_UP_CODE will stay in this file, and will be referred to by both the code-list-by-id reducer and the codes-by-id reducer.\nString constants used to identify actions are defined inline in the file.\nContants\nAll constants are defined in one of these 4 files in the constants directory: \n\npogues-constants.js for constants related to implementation details;\ndictionnary.js for internationalization;\nconstants-mapping.js the mapping between a constat defined in the pogues-contants.js file and the dictionary.js dictionary.\nschema.js for constants coming from the XML Schema;\n\nFonts\nThe different fonts used by the application are located in this folder. \nHelp\nFolder where is define the Help page. \nHome\nFolder where is define the Home page of the application, displaying the list of questionnaires.\nLayout\nIn this folder, we will define all components used in any pages of the application. The rule we try to follow, is to create a dedicated folder by component. In this folder, you will find the main JavaScript file, the corresponding unit test, and maybe a components subdirectory with subcomponent used by this one. \nQuestionnaire\nFolder where is defined the page displaying the information of a questionnaire.\nReducers\nAll the reducers stay in the reducers directory.\nMost of them handle a piece of state consisting of a collection of entities and follow the somethings-by-id naming convention.\nReducer files use a single export default statement.\nThe app-state sub folder contains reducers which are not supposed to have any effect on the questionnaire by itself, but hold information about the UI state.\nSCSS\nIn this folder, we will define the stylesheet of the application. We use the SCSS language, a superset of CSS. WebPack  will be in charge of compiling all our SCSS files into= CSS during the build phase\n\n\n\nThe stylesheet is splitted by component. For component needed a stylesheet, you will find a dedicated file in the inc folder.\nAt the root of the scc folder, you will find other file with general configuration.\nThe main file pogues.scss will be in charge of importing everything. \nError: file not found: /github/workspace/local_source/src/scss/pogues.scss\n\nStore\nin this folder is defined the configure-store.js file, used my the main JavaScript file of the application, in order to configure the Redux store.\nUtils\nAre defined in thie directory all utility modules needed in the application. We try to split this folder into subfolder, in order to improve the structure of the application. The name of the subfolder will correspond to the part of the application using this utility module. For example, we have : \n\ncomponent : used by React components\ndictionary : used by the internationalization behavior\nreducer : used by reducers\ntest : used by unit tests\ntransformation-entities : for the differents transformations of the model. \n\n"},"developper-guide/application/style-guide.html":{"url":"developper-guide/application/style-guide.html","title":"Style Guide","keywords":"","body":"Pogues style guide\nThis document is where choices regarding styling should live.\nColors\nSequences\n\noutline (highlighted border, etc.): #7F689D\nbackground (use sparingly): #B5A8C4\nlevel 1 title: #513179\nlevel 2 title: #684C8C\nlevel 3 title: #9785AD\n\nQuestions\n\ntitle: #A73B4E\noutline (highlighted border, etc.): #D98997\nbackground (use sparingly): #F4CED4\n\nQuestionnaire outlook\n\nborder: #E7E092\nbackground: #FFFCD7\n\nButtons\n\nmain or positive action: #2B5A71\nother action: #A0B3BC\n\n"},"developper-guide/application/more-on-reducers.html":{"url":"developper-guide/application/more-on-reducers.html","title":"More on reducers","keywords":"","body":"More on reducers and actions\nHandling actions\nAt first, reducers in Pogues were written with switch statements:\nfunction myReducer(state, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case SOMETHING:\n      return {...}\n    case ANOTHER:\n      return {...}\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\n\nAs the code grew, we found that this implementation was not always easy to read (some cases need a bit of logic) and we favored the representation of the different cases with an object of functions. Each key represents an action type, each value, a handler which needs to be called to process an action of this given type. This handler:\n\ntakes the state (for instance the codes for the codes-by-id reducer) as its first argument;\ntakes the action's payload as its second argument;\nreturns the new state.\n\nFrom the code-by-id reducer:\n//a dictionary with all the action types which need to be proccessed by this\n//reducer, with the corresponding `handler`\nconst actionsHndlrs = {\n  CREATE_CODE: createCode,\n  REMOVE_CODE: removeCode,\n  EDIT_CODE: editCode,\n  ...\n}\n\n//generic utility function to replace `switch` statements\nexport default function (state={}, action) {\n  if (!action) return state\n  const { type, payload } = action\n  const hndlr = actionsHndlrs[type]\n  return hndlr ? hndlr(state, payload, action) : state\n}\n\n//a handler for the `CREATE_CODE` action\nfunction createCode(codes, { id, label, value }) {\n  return {\n    //start with a fresh copy of the state\n    ...codes,\n    //add the new entry\n    [id]: {\n      id, label, value\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n...\n\nThe generic utility function could benefit to be shared by all the reducers (instead of being defined inline in each reducer).\nReducers handle collections of entities\nMost reducers handle a piece of state which consist in a collection of entities. For instance, the codes-by-id reducer is a collection (a JavaScript object literal) where each key represents a code id, and each value, information about the code corresponding to this id.\nThe different patterns described below are quite general. Adding some utility functions to reduce boilerplate could be an interesting option.\nAdd a new entry:\nfunction createCode(codes, { id, label, value }) {\n  return {\n    ...codes,\n    [id]: {\n      id, label, value\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nRemove an existing entry:\nfunction removeCode(codes, { id }) {\n  //usage of the spread operator is very convenient to take apart the entry\n  //with the given id and all the remaining entries\n  const { [id]: toRemove, ...toKeep } = codes\n  return toKeep\n}\n\nUpdate an existing code:\nfunction editCode(codes, { id, update }) {\n  return {\n    //start with a fresh copy of the state\n    ...codes,\n    //override the entry for the given id\n    [id]: {\n      //start with a fresh copy of this entry\n      ...codes[id],\n      //apply the update (all the keys present in the payload will override the\n      //corresponding existing keys)\n      ...update\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nIntegrity checks\nThe main reducer for this application is build dynamically to process integrity checks on the questionnaire.\n"},"developper-guide/application/internationalization.html":{"url":"developper-guide/application/internationalization.html","title":"Internationalization","keywords":"","body":"Internationalization\nThe application is available in french and english.

Most of the highlights in this file are related to ES2015 syntax.\nDestructuring\nDestructuring assignments allow to extract some information from an object or an array. They look like this:\nconst person = { firstname: 'john', lastname: 'doe' }\nconst { firstname, lastname } = person\nconsole.log(firstname) // 'john'\nconsole.log(lastname) // 'doe'\n\nThis approach can be used for destructuring function arguments. We use them a lot when defining React components:\nfunction CodeEditor(props) {\n  let label = props.label\n  (...)\n}\n\ncan be rewritten as:\nfunction CodeEditor({ label }) {\n  return (...)\n}\n\nDestructuring assignments are also frequently used in combination with array functions:\nvar codes = [{ id: '...', label: '...'}, { id: '...', label: '...' }]\ncodes.map(function (code) {\n  const id = code.id\n  const label = code.label\n  return ... //do something with id and label\n  }\n)\n}\n\ncan be rewritten as:\nvar codes = [{ id: '...', label: '...'}, { id: '...', label: '...' }]\ncodes.map(({id, label}) => ) {\n  return ... //do something with id and label\n  }\n)\n}\n\nSpread operator with arrays\nIt can be useful to update an array without mutating the initial one:\nconst initialArray = ['john', 'jack', 'bob']\n\n//keep all except the first one\nconst [dontCare, ...withoutFirst] = initialArray\n\n//add an entry\nconst withOneMore = [...initialArray, 'kate']\n\nSpread operator with objects\nThis syntax is not part of ES2015, but might be part of future JavaScript versions. Like ES2015 syntax, it is supported thanks to babel, with the transform-object-rest-spread plugin.\nIt allows to make a copy of some object before updating some properties:\nconst initialObject = {\n  id1: 'one',\n  id2: 'two',\n  id3: 'three'\n}\n\n//`initialObject` won't be modified\nconst newObject = {\n  ...initialObject,\n  id2: 'deux'\n}\n//another way to do this can be\n// const newObject = Object.assign(initialObject, { id2: 'deux' })\n\nWe can also use the spread operator to keep all the entries except one (useful to remove an entry):\nconst initialObject = {\n  john: 25,\n  jack: 65,\n  bob: 35\n}\n\n//we want to remove the \"jack\" entry\nconst {\n  jack: dontCare,\n  ...withoutJack\n} = initialObject\n\n//`withoutJack` is the new object\n`\n\nComputed property names\nUsually, to create an object when a key comes from a variable, we write that kind of code:\nconst firstname = 'john'\nconst names = {}\nnames[firstname] = 'doe'\n\nIn ES2015, with computed property names, we can write:\nconst firstname = 'john'\nconst names = {\n  [firstname]: 'doe'\n}\n\nIt is particularly useful in combination with the spread operator to enforce immutability when working with objects (like in a reducer). This way, we can make a copy of an object and only update one key:\nconst initialObject = {\n  id1: 'one',\n  id2: 'two',\n  id3: 'three'\n}\nconst idToProcess = 'id2'\nconst newValue = 'deux'\nconst newObject = {\n  ...initialObject,\n  [idToProcess]: newValue\n}\n\nShorthand property names\nES2015 provides a shorthand to create an object from variables when the object keys match the variables names shorter.\nvar firstname = 'john'\nvar lastname = 'doe'\n//Before ES2015\nvar person = {\n  firstname: firstname,\n  lastname: lastname\n}\n//With ES2015\nvar person = {\n  firstname,\n  lastname\n}\n\nArrow functions\nArrow functions are a short and convenient way to write small anonymous functions. They look like this:\nconst increment = a => a + 1\n\nThey are used extensively in this application, but the regular function expression function () {} is still preferred when the logic is not trivial.\nTemplate literals\nTemplate literals are convenient to describe strings that would be otherwise built by concatenating (+) multiple strings. For instance in src/js/utils/state-to-model-questionnaire.js:\nconst makePageBreakGroup = index => ({\n  name: `PAGE_${index}`,\n  label: `Components for page ${index}`,\n  ...\n})\n\nAnother advantage of template literals is that they allow to write multiline strings easily.\nExport and import\nThis application uses export and import ES6 statements. Some useful information about them can be found here Error: file not found: /github/workspace/local_source/en/developper-guide/javascript/https:/developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import and there export.\nBriefly, we can keep in mind that there are two kind of export(s): named exports and default exports. Both are used in this application.\nNamed exports follow one of these patterns:\nexport const firstNameExport = ...\n//or\nexport {\n  secondNamedExport,\n  thirdNamedExport\n}\n\nWhile default exports look like this:\nconst mainPurposeOfThisFile = ...\nexport default mainPurposeOfThisFile\n\nImports of named exports use curly brackets to identify which exported variables should be imported.\nimport { firstNameExport, secondNamedExport } from '...'\n\nwhile default exports are imported with:\nimport mainPurposeOfThisFile from '...'\n\nWhen we import a default export, the name we give to the local variable does not need to match the name defined in the module. The code above could be re-written like this:\n//We use `aRelevantName` in place of `mainPurposeOfThisFile`\nimport aRelevantName from '...'\n\nComponents\nComponents live in their own file, so we use export default to expose them. There might be in the same file a generic definition of the component, what is sometimes called a presentational component, and a 'connected' component. Most of the time, only the 'connected' component will have a purpose for the outside world, so the export looks like this (see src/js/components/component-editor.js):\nfunction ComponentEditor(...) {\n}\n...\nexport default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(ComponentEditor)\n\nImport css\nThis application uses style-loader in combination with Webpack. It allows to import css files from JavaScript. Hence, in src/js/main.js, we import the main css files the application will need:\nrequire('../css/pogues.css')\n\nIt is convenient:\n\nto mark some particular css file as a dependency for some JavaScript code to run properly;\nto process the file to make performance optimizations (inline css rules in the head section of the html file) and compatibility adjustments (for instance by adding prefixes when needed);\nto make Webpack taking care of copying this asset to the dist folder.\n\n"},"developper-guide/javascript/debugging.html":{"url":"developper-guide/javascript/debugging.html","title":"Debugging","keywords":"","body":"Debugging\nRedux DevTools\nRedux provides some useful tools for debugging.

It implements the application logic (for instance, how to update the state when we add a question).\nThe checker can be built by combining multiple checkers with the combineCheckers function. \nThe reducer built by integrityChecker will add an errors key to the application state.\nFor now, only checks of goTos consistency and questionnaire length have been implemented.\n"},"user-guide/user-guide.html":{"url":"user-guide/user-guide.html","title":"User guide","keywords":"","body":"User guide for Pogues\nLast release 2021/04/01\n\nThe main principles of Pogues\nQuestionnaire design tool for metadata-driven collection\n\nIntegrated into the RMéS-Coltrane information system\nUsing RMéS (Stastical Metadata Repository used by Insee) metadata\nProducing survey questionnaires (Coltrane) thanks to a questionnaire generator called Eno\n\n\nTarget population : survey designer\nFocus : design questionnaires in a full WYSIWYG way\n\n\nPogues, functional architecture\n\n\nConnection to the application\n\nwith your web browser, enter :\nhttp://conception-questionnaires.insee.fr\n\nenter your login and validate by clicking on \"OK\"\n\n\n\nAdvice for entry\nIn order to avoid embedding special characters that could sometimes compromise the proper functioning of the application, we strongly recommend using an intermediary like Notepad++ (encoding in UTF8) or Notepad to copy/paste between your original question list and Pogues\n\nHomepage\nFrom the Pogues home page, you can access all the questionnaires you own in order to view and or modify them by clicking on their title or to duplicate a questionnaire by clicking on the Duplicate button. \n\nCreation of a new questionnaire\nClick on the button \"New Questionnaire\"\n\n\n\nSelect for your questionnaire :\n\na series :\nfor example : Enquête trimestrielle de conjoncture dans l'artisanat du bâtiment\n\n\na statisticial operation:\nfor example : Enquête trimestrielle de conjoncture dans l'artisanat du bâtiment 2018\n\n\nthe involved campaigns :\nfor example : july and december 2018\n\n\n\n\nFill in :\n\na title\nan id \nlike a short label, by default, Pogues proposes to pre-fill it whith the first characters of the title\n\n\none or more collection modes (not completely working now)\nCAPI (face to face), CATI (phone), CAWI (Internet), PAPI (paper)\n\n\n\n\nFill in :\n\nthe logic used to specify the dynamics of the questionnaire\nGoTo (condition the hiding of certain elements of the questionnaire: jump from a starting element to a target element according to a certain condition) or Filter (condition the display of a sequence, sub-sequence or set of questions).

It can be a variable collected previously and recalled for consistency with past responses (last known turnover, last known headcount) or a variable useful for customizing some elements of the questionnaire (collection wave number to filter questions, date or geographical zoning to be displayed in a question label (year or regions for example) etc.). They are defined via the \"External variables\" tab of any question in the questionnaire.\n\nCreation of an external variable (2)\n\nInform:\n\nLabel\nId : see the one in the customization file\nResponse type : from Text, Date, Number, Boolean\nScope : Questionnaire if the variable has the same value throughout the questionnaire.

Clicking on the +Boucle button opens the next corresponding screen.\n\n\nCreation of a loop (2)\nFill in :\n\nId: compulsory, Id for the loop, at your discretion. \n\nMaximum: optional, required only if Minimum is set, maximum number of occurrences of the loop, useful only for loops that are not based on a dynamic table or a previous loop\n\nMinimum: optional, required only if Maximum is set, minimum number of loop occurrences displayed, useful only for loops that are not based on a dynamic array or a previous loop\n\nBased on: optional, allows you to indicate whether the loop should be based on a dynamic table or another loop.\n\n\n\nCreation of a loop (3)\n\nExcepted: optional, allows you to indicate via a formula the units to exclude from the loop (example: people younger than 18 years old). Warning: this filter currently only applies to qualitative variables. For a restriction on age, for example, you have to think about an indicator (for example we define AGE_RANGE = '1' for people younger than 18, TRANCHE_AGE = '2' for others): excluding people younger than 18 will be written : $AGE_RANGE$= '1'.\n\nFor example with a calculated variable having a formula of the type \nif ($AGE$\n\nCreation of a loop (4)\n\nStart: obligatory, allows you to indicate the first element (sequence or sub-sequence) on which to loop.\n\nEnd: obligatory, allows you to indicate the last element (sequence or sub-sequence) on which to loop. When the loop consists of a single sequence or sub-sequence, Start and End will be identical.\n\nAdd button label: optional, label of the add button of a loop occurrence when it exists and when Minimum is different from Maximum. Example: Add a product, Add a service, Add an individual\nIf \"Based on\" is entered, then this button does not need to be filled in, as the loop is based on a previous loop.\n\n\nValidate\n\nCreation of a loop (5)\nIf you want to review the specification of a loop and/or modify and/or delete it, you will find all the specified loops on the left hand side of the questionnaire edit screen in Pogues, under the sequence list.\nPlease note that, pending the availability of ad hoc computer resources, the loops are not currently edited in the odt specification format.\n\n\nAdding an existing questionnaire\nIt is now possible to merge two questionnaires by clicking on the +Questionnaire button (at the bottom of the GUI and to the right of the Visualise button) from the questionnaire you wish to place first. You can then choose among the questionnaires you own (be careful to define beforehand the same collection modes for the initial questionnaire and the questionnaire to be added afterwards), the one you wish to add to it afterwards. If some elements share the same identifier, the identifier of the second occurrence will be suffixed by _2, excepting codelist sharing the same technical id (if the two lists are different, the one from the second questionnaire will be taken into account).\n\nFunctionalities related to a questionnaire element\nOn each created element of the sequence/sub-sequence or question type questionnaire, there are the \"Show the detail\", \"Visualise\" (Web,PDF,Specification or DDI) and \"Delete\" buttons.\nOn a question, there is also the \"Duplicate\" button.\n\n\n\"Show the detail\" allows you to view the element and modify it if necessary.\n\"Visualise\" allows you to view only the element you are on. Please note that the formulas (controls, redirections) are not applied to the unit view but only to the whole questionnaire (visualise at the bottom of the HMI).\n\"Delete\" allows you to delete an item.\n\"Duplicate\" is used to copy a question. Don't forget to modify the identifier of the duplicate question and the identifier of the collected variable(s) associated with the duplicate, as you can't have the same id for several questions or several collected variables. It is currently not possible to duplicate a code list and keep the original code list and a modified duplicate code list. Any changes to the duplicate code list are currently reflected in the original duplicate code list.\n\nMove elements by drag and drop\nIt is currently possible to move an element of type sequence, sub-sequence, question by drag and drop. To do this, select the element and drag and drop it to the desired location (even if it means unzooming enough to have on the same screen the question to move and the part of the questionnaire tree where you want to move it).\nBe careful, the movement of a sequence or sub-sequence also moves its children (sub-sequences or questions related to it). \nBe careful with the elements moved in case of redirection, the target of a question must not be found before this question.\n\n\n\nSave or Visualise the questionnaire\nIt is possible to save or view (Web,PDF,Interviewer form, Specification or DDI) the questionnaire at any time (or almost) via the dedicated buttons at the bottom of the page of the Pogues interface. \nThe \"Publish\" button will soon be available, it means to publish/register the questionnaire within the RMéS repository. \nThe \"Page break\" button is currently not working.\n\n\nShow the detail or delete the questionnaire\nIt is possible to \"show the detail\" of a questionnaire (you can see and perhaps modify informations filled in when creating a questionnaire) or to \"delete\" it with the dedicated buttons at the top of the page. \n\n\nChecking the integrity of the questionnaire\nThe following questionnaire integrity checks are currently being implemented:\n\nthe questionnaire must include at least a sequence and a question\nuniqueness of question, sequence or sub-sequence identifiers\nuniqueness of collected, external or calculated variables identifiers\n\n\nWhat is not yet working in Pogues (1)\nmanual DDI add-on \n\nFill in a pattern (specify a regular expression) for a text response\nManage hypelinks and mailtos\nManage surveys linked to several models of questionnaires\nAssociate images to response modalities (example : arrows for conjuncture surveys)\nManage units other than €, k€, %, hours, days, months, years\n\n\n\nTaking into account multimode (CAWI, CAPI, PAPI, CATI)\nCan be filled in but is not taken into account in the display of the questionnaire\nThe link between Pogues and RMéS and in particular to publish the questionnaire or reuse a question or a code list (e.g. departments, countries, nomenclature) from the repository \nCondition the label of a question according to the answers previously obtained \nThe \"Page break\" button at the bottom center of the interface Pogues\npdf settings (number of columns, portrait or landscape layout, type of entry, numbering, number of questions per page)\n\n\nchoice of numbering type among:\n\n1 numbering from 1 to n for all the questions in the questionnaire: this is the most common numbering in the literature, the one found in the insee's household questionnaires in general. It is also the easiest to use when there are filters to describe in a paper questionnaire.\n1 numbering from 1 to n for each of the questionnaire sequences (1 is repeated for each new sequence): this is the most common numbering in INSEE company surveys.\nno numbering: this is a choice that can be made when there are many filters, and leads to an apparent numbering that can be a little strange. This is the choice of the employment survey in particular.\n\n\nWhat we don't yet know how to do in Pogues\n\nAdd totals (fixed at 100% or calculated as the sum of the elements in the column) to a table of collected variables\nmanual DDI add-on\n-... \n\nWhat we won't do in Pogues\n\nSpecify if the redirection or filter is of type hidden filter (it is by default) or grayed filter\nmanual DDI add-on \n\n\n\n"},"user-guide/user-release-note.html":{"url":"user-guide/user-release-note.html","title":"User release note","keywords":"","body":"Release notes\n09/04/21\nDear Pogues users,\nA new version of Pogues is now available in production.\nHere are the main new features:\n\nNew input conditions\nIt is now mandatory to declare a minimum and a maximum for any number field, whether it is collected, external or calculated. \n\n-Statements: \n                -until now the possible statement types were Help, Warning, Instruction and Comment. On the web or on paper, they were not really distinguished. This list has been revised in order to take into account the collection by interviewer. From now on, the modalities will be :\n                            - Help (when it concerns the respondent, whatever the mode: paper, web, with interviewer) ;\n                            - Instruction (when it must be seen only by the interviewer);\n                            - Code-card (for questions where the interviewer will have to present a code-card to the respondent): the choice of such a deposit should lead to a particular visual (an icon a priori) on the future Queen interviewer station.\n            -an attribute has also been to a statement: the collection mode. It is now important to enter the collection mode of a statement since it will soon be used to decide whether or not to display a statement on the questionnaires, which will make it possible to have statements specific to the interviewer modes (CAPI and CATI), for example, which will not be displayed on the web or on paper. \n-It is now possible to redirect the respondent to the end of the questionnaire by choosing the target QUESTIONNAIRE_END in the Target field of the Goto tab. \n\nNew features and bug fixes\nthe \"Modifications not validated\" pop-up that warns you when you have consulted and possibly modified a tab without validating it, can now be bypassed without having to revalidate or cancel all the previously consulted tabs. Two buttons have therefore been added to the pop-up:\n\"Validate as is\" to allow you to validate all your validated changes to the item\n\"Back\" if you prefer to validate your last updates on the tabs before validating;\n\n-The specifications have been enriched and contain the tooltips, filters (start, end, conditions) and loops (content, loop type) described for the questionnaire. In case of redirection, the filtered variables are also shown with the mention \"filter\";\n-Code list : \n            -It is now possible to create a list of codes by importing a csv file, encoded in utf8, respecting the format of the following example:\nParent;Value;Label;\n;code1;label1;\n;code2;label2;\n;code3;label3;\n;code4;label4;\n;code5;label5;\n;code6;label6;\n;code7;label7;\n;code8;label8;\n;code9;label9;\n;code10;label10;\nParent will store the parent code when the code list is hierarchical and will therefore be empty in general\nValue will store the code of each modality\nLabel will store the label of each modality\n            -A \"Duplicate Code List\" button allows you, when checked, to duplicate a code list to create a variant. The title of the initial list will be suffixed by _2 at first for the duplicated list and then will be modifiable by your care in Pogues;\n-Loops: in the case of a loop that does not rely on a dynamic array or another loop, it will now be possible to indicate in the GUI the minimum number of loop occurrences displayed by default (until now it was always 1 and the user only indicated the maximum number of loop occurrences) ;\n-It is now possible to merge two questionnaires by clicking from the initial questionnaire on the +Questionnaire button (at the bottom of the GUI and to the right of Visualize). You can then choose among the questionnaires you own, the one you wish to add to it. Warning: make sure you define the same collection modes for the initial questionnaire and the questionnaire to be added to it! If some elements (sequences, sub-sequences, questions, variables, loops, code list) share the same identifier, the identifier of the second occurrence will be suffixed by _2 ;\n-The default size of text responses has been changed from 255 characters (long field) to 249: this choice is more consistent with the transformations performed by Eno (limit of passage between a long field and a short field on the paper for example);\n-The filter identifiers have been removed, as they have no use of their own;\n-An error message will indicate, if necessary, all the redirections in error (cf. redirection target modified or deleted after having specified the redirection);\n-The text alternatives for the paper mode to the redirections or filters referencing external, calculated or collected variables will now be correctly personalised on the pdf;\n-Bugs on calculated variables with a dynamic table scope have been fixed.\nSincerely yours,\nThe Pogues team\n01/03/21\nDear Pogues users,\nThe new version of Pogues in production contains the following enhancements:\n\nIt is now possible to duplicate a questionnaire you own via a Duplicate button accessible from the home page listing all your questionnaires;\n\nthe \"Collected\" boolean, accessible for variables collected within a table, and allowing you to indicate that a table cell will not be collected, is now accessible for variables collected within multiple choice questions;\n\nthe \"End if\" of a filter, recalling the last element composing a filter, is now systematically displayed even when the filter is composed of a single element;\n\nThe front office has been refactoring so that the set of questionnaires owned by the user when accessing the Pogues home page is no longer loaded into the store as it is today, but only the metadata of the questionnaires on the home page. The loading of a questionnaire in the store is now done when the user explicitly accesses the questionnaire;\n\nMatching of scope and IterableReference of loops when the \"Based on\" field (optional) of a loop is modified.\n\n\nSee you soon,\nThe Pogues team\n"}}}
