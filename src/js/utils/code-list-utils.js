/**
 * Returns the number of code in a code list from its `id`
 *
 * For a code list specification, it returns `1`.
 * If the `id` is not provided, it returns `1`.
 * If there is no code in the code list, it returns `1`.
 *
 * Explanations :
 *
 * For a code list specification which has not been loaded yet, we do not know
 * the number of codes in the code list. We need this number in order to
 * serialize the questionnaire (how many `Response` do we need to create ?).
 *
 * If a code list specification has been loaded (ie `isLoaded` is `true`), we
 * could know the number of codes, but since we cannot ensure that the
 * specification will be loaded when the questionnaire will be parsed and
 * further updated, we use `1` as a safe convention, whether it has been loaded
 * or not.
 *
 * If the `id` is not provided, the user might not have selected the code list
 * yet, so we do not know the number of codes. But since this number will be
 * used to generate responses and responses hold the information about the
 * datatype, we choose to return `1` by default to have at least one response
 * to infer datatype when retrieving a questionnaire.
 *
 * Same reason to return 1 instead of 0 when there is no code in the code list.
